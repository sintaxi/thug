# thug

## Why?

Thug was created to minimize the complexity of validating and altering an
object before writing it to a data store or performing an operation. Thug is
not an ORM but is ment to be a replacment for one. Thug is very small and
works on both the server or in a browser.

## Instalation

I always recomend you bundle your dependencies with your application. To do
this, create a `package.json` file in the root of your project with the
minimum information...

    {
      "name": "yourapplication",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "dependencies": {
        "thug": "0.4.2"
      }
    }

Then run the following command using npm...

    npm install

OR, if you just want to start playing with the library run...

    npm install thug

## Docs

Creating a basic store using Thug ...

    var store = new Thug()
    
    store.constructor.prototype.write = function(identifier, record, callback){
      // store the record any way you wish
      // fire callback with record
    }

    store.constructor.prototype.read = function(identifier, callback){
      // retrieve the record
      // invoke callback with record
    }
    
    store.constructor.prototype.remove = function(identifier, callback){
      // remove the record
      // invoke callback with errors or null
    }

This gives us three basic methods `set`, `get`, `valid` ...
    
    store.set("foo", "bar", function(errors, record){
      // errors => null
      // record => "bar"
    })
    
    store.get("foo", function(errors, record){
      // record => "bar"
    })
    
    store.validate("foo", "bar", function(errors, record){
      // errors => null
      // record => "bar"
    })

What we have created is a basic key/value store using `Thug` nothing special
yet. Thug has two basic building blocks for you to use `filters` and
`validations`.

## Filters

Creating a filter is simple, just create a function that calls the next filter
in the stack. Here is a simple filter that just logs the record to the console.

    var log = function(record, next){
      console.log(record)
      next(record)
    }

Now that we have a `filter` we put it in our model where we want it to be
called. There are four different places within the lifecycle of a call that the
filter can be called.

    var store = new Thug({
      filters: {
        in             : [],
        beforeValidate : [],
        beforeWrite    : [],
        out            : []
      }
    })

### `in` filters

`in` filters are ran when the `set` and `valid` functions are first called.
This is useful when black-listing or white-listing properties on the record
before the `validations` are ran.

### `beforeValidate` filters

`beforeValidate` filters are called immediately prior to `validations` being called but after the `read` function is called in the cases where there is and
`identifier` passed in. This is were you will do most of your heavy lifting
in constructing your object data before going to the store such as setting a
timestamp, generating a uuid or creating a hash based on a password.

### `beforeWrite` filters

`beforeWrite` filters are ran immediately after `validations` are ran but still
before the `write` function is called. This is the last opportunity to clean
the data up before storing the record. For example, you may want to delete a
naked password.

### `out` filters

`out` filters are ran immediately after the `write` function is ran. This is
your opportunity to clean the data up before returning to the client.

## Validations

A validation is a function that takes the arguments `field`, `record`,
`errors`, `callback`. 

    var noBob = function(field, record, errors, callback){
      if(record[field] === "Bob") errors.push("cannot be Bob")
      callback()
    }

To use this validation, add to the field you would like to validate on.

    var store = new Thug({
      validations:{
        name: [noBob]
      }
    })

Now if we were to attempt to set an object in the store that has a name of
"Bob". We will get an error object back and the object will not be saved.

    store.set({ name: "Bob" }, function(errors, record){
      console.log(errors)
    })

The errors object will look like this...

    {
      messages: ["name cannot be Bob"],
      details: {
        name: ["cannot be Bob"]
      }
    }

## API

### `set([identifier,] record, callback)`

#### Lifecycle of a `set()` request

  1. record is passed through `in` filters
  2. `read` is called (if identifier is present)
  3. record is passed through `beforeValidate` filters
  4. `validations` are ran

If record fails validation, we return back to the client. otherwise continue...

  5. record is passed through `beforeWrite` filters
  6. `write` is called
  7. record is passed through `out` filters
  8. fires callback
    
### `validate([identifier,] record, callback)`

The `validate` call is a subset of `set`. It fires the callback after validations
are ran but does not perform the beforeWrite filters nor call the `write` function.

#### Lifecycle of a `valid()` request

  1. record is passed through `in` filters
  2. `read` is called (if identifier is present)
  3. record is passed through `beforeValidate` filters
  4. `validations` are ran
  5. fires callback
    
### `get(identifier, callback)`

The `get` function calls the `read` function and passes the record through the
`out` filters.

#### Lifecycle of a `get()` request

  1. `read` is called
  2. if record is found, it is passed through `out` filters
  3. fires callback
